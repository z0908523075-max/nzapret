**nzapret** is an autonomous and lightweight module for rooted Android devices. The module is **based on [zapret2](https://github.com/bol-van/zapret2)**, using the local `nfqws2` engine and `iptables`/`ip6tables` rules for DPI bypass, as well as the built-in `nztg` proxy to unblock Telegram.

The `nfqws2` binaries, payloads, and routing lists are sourced from the original upstream, the `nztg` proxy server is built on a custom Go implementation, and the entire wrapper code is written from scratch for Android — offering a convenient WebUI and avoiding system bloat.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Built-in WebUI:** A convenient and beautiful graphical interface right inside the KernelSU module manager.
- **Powerful CLI:** Complete module management via terminal.
- **Smart Routing:** Intercepts traffic in the `OUTPUT` and `FORWARD` chains for both IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Auto-determined IP Stack:** The module automatically spins up interception rules for IPv4 and, if `ip6tables` is supported, for IPv6 — without requiring manual selection.
- **Telegram Bypass:** A built-in local MTProto proxy (`nztgproxy`) with WebSocket-over-TLS bridging and Cloudflare fallback, managed alongside the main service.
- **Private DNS Management:** Automatic DNS initialization and provider switching from WebUI/CLI.
- **Personal `list-user`:** A user's custom domain list, editable directly from the interface.
- **VPN Compatibility:** Support for working alongside most popular VPN clients.
- **Autonomous:** The module uses local data and does not require internet connectivity on boot.

<summary>⚙️ Detailed Network, DNS, and Telegram Logic (for geeks)</summary>

- **Network Stack:** The module always brings up DPI interception for IPv4, and for IPv6 when `ip6tables` (mangle table) is supported on the device. There is no separate mode selector and it is not needed: idle IPv6 rules cost nothing when IPv6 traffic is absent and are ready to protect IPv6 as soon as it comes up later (e.g., on Wi-Fi/cellular handovers). This eliminates the legacy issue where in "IPv4-only mode" traffic (e.g., YouTube or Instagram) would leak over IPv6 past the bypass.
- **Private DNS:** Initialized once during the first service start. If a valid third-party DNS provider is already configured in "Hostname" mode on the system, it is preserved. In other cases ("Disabled", "Auto", or empty), it defaults to `xbox-dns.ru` (required to bypass DNS blocks for AI services like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.). Manual DNS changes via CLI or WebUI are saved and not reset on subsequent starts.
- **Telegram Proxy (nztgproxy):** A local Go-based MTProto proxy (static, CGO-free `nztg` binary). It accepts incoming MTProto connections from the Telegram client, decodes the obfuscated handshake, and bridges traffic to the official Telegram DCs over WSS (WebSocket-over-TLS) to bypass DPI IP blocks. Supports direct TCP fallback and Cloudflare Worker / CDN fronting (CF proxy) to route traffic through the Cloudflare network if the direct WebSocket server IPs of Telegram are blocked by the ISP.

## 🚧 Limitations and Known Issues

> [!NOTE]
> **Telegram:** The module includes a built-in local MTProto proxy (`nztgproxy`) to bypass Telegram blocks. After starting the module, open the **Telegram** tab in WebUI and click **"Open in Telegram"** (or copy the link/enter `127.0.0.1:1443` and Secret manually). If Telegram IPs are blocked by the provider, traffic goes through the Cloudflare proxy automatically. If media fails to load, remove the `2:149.154.167.220` line in the DC configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> **KernelSU WebUI Bug:** Due to KernelSU manager specifics, `nfqws2` and `nztg` processes started *manually* via the **Start** button in WebUI may be terminated by the system when KernelSU is swiped away from recent apps. This bug is fixed in KernelSU-Next (see issue [#1180](https://github.com/KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next/issues/1180))! For standard KernelSU, it is recommended to use the **Action** button in the module list or run `nzapret start` in a terminal.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
1. Download the pre-built `ZIP` archive from the Releases page.
2. Flash it standardly via **Magisk** or **KernelSU**.
3. Reboot the device.
4. Open the modules tab in KernelSU to access the **WebUI**. *(Magisk users will need the [KsuWebUI](https://github.com/KOWX712/KsuWebUIStandalone) app to use the interface).*

### 2. CLI Usage
Managing via CLI requires root privileges (`su`). If the `nzapret` command is not in your PATH, use the full path: `/data/adb/modules/nzapret/system/bin/nzapret`.

## 🛠 Module Compilation

If you want to build the module yourself, you need basic utilities installed on your system (Linux/WSL): `bash`, `zip`, `sed`, `mktemp`.

The build process is launched with a single command:
```sh
bash build.sh
```
The flashable `nzapret-vX.Y.Z.zip` archive will be created in the root directory. You can build it on the device (e.g., in Termux) or on a PC.
